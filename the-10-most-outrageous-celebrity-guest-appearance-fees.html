Clowns, magicians, and the like just won’t cut it anymore. Therefore, people with a lot of money decided that it would be a great idea to blow off heaps of their cash to get a celebrity to appear in their parties. A big star’s time and effort isn’t cheap, but you’ll be surprised at how much they charge to appear for just a short amount of time. Check out these 10 outrageous celebrity guest appearance fees</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/50-cent-Copy.jpg alt="Miguel Cotto v Sergio Martinez" width=640 height=493 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>50 Cent</strong></p><p>It costs 50 cents to get 50 Cent to make an appearance. No, we are just kidding since it’s a lot higher than that. If you want him to show up at your party to either hang out or perform, you better be prepared to shell out $600,000 to book him for it. A lot of people have probably paid 50 Cent a lot of cash just to show up in birthday parties and sing one of his most famous songs “In Da Club” to set the mood.</p><p>(Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cher-Copy.jpg alt='Cher Performs On NBC&#39;s "Today"' width=639 height=461 sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Cher</strong></p><p>Who knew that Cher still had the power to command such a high booking price? She asks for $1.5 million just to make an appearance at a private event. We wonder if that just includes her singing or does that include a variety of other activities as well considering the high fee? Kudos to Cher for still being a catch and a big star despite of the fact that she’s competing with a lot of other younger talent.</p><p>(Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Christina-Aguilera-Copy.jpg alt="2013 American Music Awards - Arrivals" width=640 height=425 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></p><p>The Voice judge is still in demand for performances and appearances. Aguilera was reportedly paid $1 million for an hour long performance at a private Halloween party in San Diego. We hope that she was able to squeeze in as much songs as she can because that’s one heavy price tag. It’s still going to be expensive though if you only want her for a few minutes since it’ll roughly cost you $16,666 per 60 seconds.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Elton-John-Copy.jpg alt="Fizz Las Vegas Grand Opening At Caesars Palace" width=639 height=459 sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Elton John</strong></p><p>Reports say that the famous singer would cost around $1.5- 2 million to book for an appearance at a private event. We hope that this isn’t the hourly rate or else you would need to be a sizeable millionaire to book John at your event. He might not be making any new music lately, but his success surely sustains him since a lot of people still want him to perform in public and private venues.</p><p>(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jay-Z-Copy.jpg alt="Miami Heat v Brooklyn Nets - Game Four" width=638 height=510 sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Jay Z</strong></p><p>The rapper charges a minimum fee of $1- 1.5 million for appearances. We heard that’s how much he earned for performing in a New Year’s party at the Cosmopolitan Resort in Vegas. If you think that’s expensive, Mrs. Carter was paid an even higher amount to appear in another party. She got $2 million from a single event. No wonder these two are considered the power couple of the music industry.</p><p>(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kevin-Federline-Copy.jpg alt="Kevin Federline Makes Ed Hardy Instore Appearance" width=641 height=467 sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></p><p>No, Britney Spears’ ex hubby doesn’t command millions of dollars to make an appearance. However, it’s quite surprising that people would pay him at all to even show up at an event. He expects more than $300,000 per appearance. Thankfully, that’s not his hourly rate or else it would be absurd. We heard it’s the same amount Leonardo DiCaprio charges too and that feels like an injustice.&nbsp; We’ll say that again.&nbsp; Kevin Federline charges the same amount as Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><p>(Photo by David Hardenberg/Getty Images)</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mariah-Carey-Copy.jpg alt='Mariah Carey Performs On NBC&#39;s "Today"' width=639 height=434 sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></p><p>Keeping Mimi happy isn’t just difficult, she’s also very expensive to book as well. Her time and attention will cost you $1 million if you really want her to make an appearance. Reports even say that the price tag is only worth 4 songs. Hopefully, her performance lives up to the astronomical fee. To her credit, Carey definitely has the talent to back it up since she’s an award winning singer with lots of hits under her belt. Just how many private appearances has she made?</p><p>(Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Michael-Buble-Copy.jpg alt="Michael Buble Australian Tour - Press Conference" width=638 height=419 sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Michael Buble</strong></p><p>Buble isn’t as big and popular of a singer as he used to be years ago, but he could still charge a hefty amount for an appearance. For a 2 hour event, you can ask him to sing his heart out for roughly $300,000 to $400,000. He can sing you all of the hits from the past without having to pay for its original singers to appear as well. Just a warning though, his fee is twice the budget of most engaged couples for their entire weddings.</p><p>(Photo by Don Arnold/WireImage)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/The-Situation-Copy.jpg alt="The 53rd Annual GRAMMY Awards - Arrivals" width=640 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>The Situation</strong></p><p>Like Federline, it makes you wonder why this guy is even on this list. However, it’ll make you feel a little bit better since he doesn’t ask quite as much so he isn’t that in demand. He charges $50,000 per appearance and we admit that it’s still a lot of money. We wonder if his booking fee is still the same since he’s been having addiction issues off the camera. That has got to affect his marketability and monetary worth in the future.&nbsp; Still though, 50K is a lot of money.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Usher-Copy.jpg alt="2012 BET Awards - Ford Hot Spot Room - Day 2" width=640 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Usher</strong></p><p>Booking Usher for a private gig would cost you $1 million and that’s just for one hour. That’s not even enough time to fit all of his greatest hits. I guess if you want to enjoy Usher’s appearance, you should be ready to book him for more than an hour. Maybe you just want to get him to judge your singing skills like he does on&nbsp;The Voice. If so, that’s the most expensive singing lesson we’ve ever heard of.</p><p>(Photo by Maury Phillips/Getty Images For BET)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWfqsGzrcaepq6rXZiyrbHBq6CtsV2cwqa%2F02aYqaiVlr%2BiusKeZJ%2Bdlah8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./worker-at-the-genius-bar-nyt-crossword-clue-answer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Worker at the Genius Bar NYT Crossword Clue Answer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-andrew-monika-jakisic-split-royal-clooney-s-ex-break-up.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Andrew, Monika Jakisic Split: Royal, Clooney's Ex Break Up</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
