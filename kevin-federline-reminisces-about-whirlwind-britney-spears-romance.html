From their surprise wedding to their UPN reality show to their contentious divorce, custody battle, and Spears' mental breakdown, the couple's relationship was like her 2008 album — a Circus. These days, though, the craziness between them is just a memory.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood's friendliest exes</a></p><p>"That time, it's like a whirlwind,” Federline, 36, told <a href=#>Access Hollywood Live</a> hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover of his 2004 to 2007 marriage to the "Work Bitch" singer. "You know, you're thrown into this limelight…Everything kinda happened."</p><p>Which is not to say it was bad. They had their problems, of course, but they also had two adorable sons, <strong>Sean</strong>, 9, and <strong>Jayden</strong>, 8. (Spears, 33, gave birth to their second child two months before she filed for divorce.)</p><p>"I mean, it was a good time in my life," the aspiring DJ recalled. "We have two beautiful children. The way that everything has turned out, everybody's happy. Co-parenting is going great. I can't complain."</p><p>Indeed, despite some early fighting over the kids after their split — which culminated in the singer's 2007 meltdown, complete with a head-shaving incident and rehab — Federline and Spears seem to be in a good, peaceful place. They've worked out a schedule for the boys over the years, but they also try to be accommodating of each other's busy careers.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I had to work this weekend and go to Orange County…so they went to Vegas," he shared. "And when she has to do something and I need to keep the kids, it just works out well."</p><p>The important thing, he added, is that their sons always come first. "We talk when we need to, and it's always about the boys — mostly school stuff and making sure we stay on top of that," he explained. "It's going great. I'm in a happy place right now."</p><p>That's thanks in part to his wife <strong>Victoria Prince</strong>, a former volleyball player. The lovebirds, who married in 2013, have two daughters together, <strong>Jordan</strong>, 3, and <strong>Peyton</strong>, 10 months. Federline also has two kids, <strong>Kori</strong> and <strong>Kaleb</strong>, from his relationship with ex-girlfriend <strong>Shar Jackson</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKerpmjeqexw56ppaGemnqzscyipaKrk5rAbq3BqKytZaedtrO41qKlnWWSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnRqKSappOaenN8kG5wbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./little-mix-and-lewis-capaldi-win-big-at-radio-1-s-teen-awards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Little Mix and Lewis Capaldi win big at Radio 1s Teen Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-paquin-net-worth-how-rich-is-paquin-in-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Paquin Net Worth How Rich is Paquin in 2024?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
