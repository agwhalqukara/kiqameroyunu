"She's not going to have a set offense that you have to run. She's going to tailor everything to what she has on her team and what's going to put her team in positions to be very successful."</p><p>The 22-year-old thrived under Bluder, becoming one of the most prominent figures in college sports and leading the Hawkeyes on several March Madness runs. Clark averaged 28.4 points per game in her collegiate career, becoming the NCAA's all-time leading scorer on March 3 and earning three consecutive Big Ten Player of the Year awards.</p><p>She was selected by the Fever with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft.</p><p>As for Bluder, she leaves Iowa with a 528-254 record after she took over as head coach ahead of the 2000-01 season. She earned three Big Ten Coach of the Year awards and was <a href=# rel=noopener>named</a> the 2019 Naismith Women's College Coach of the Year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmWGcn%2BMnJiirJyeu26vy5qppGWkna6vt9Jmo6KrkWKvrcHDnqlmnp%2BneqOxy6Kcr6GenHqquoyhnKtlkZvBpr6MoqawmV2ssKOujKGaZqqVqbazsdI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./catherine-zeta-jones-posts-throwback-pic-of-husband-michael-douglas-with-his-3-kids-on-father-s-da.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Catherine Zeta-Jones Posts Throwback Pic Of Husband Michael Douglas With His 3 Kids On Fathers Da</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amber-marshall-kids-net-worth-age-spouses.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amber Marshall Kids, Net Worth, Age, Spouses.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
