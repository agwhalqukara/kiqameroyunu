Basshunter’s brand new song is out now and it’s been such a long wait for “Masterpiece” since his previous single which was 2012’s “Elinor” – which was a fan-favourite. It is not known whether this new single is from a forthcoming album, but we sure hope it is.</p><p>Basshunter, real name Jonas Altberg, is a Swedish DJ superstar who first hit it big in Europe with the Swedish song “Boten Anna” and with the follow-up “Vi sitter i Ventrilo och spelar&nbsp;DotA” before transforming both songs into English versions titled “Now You’re Gone” and “All I Ever Wanted”. The former hit the UK Charts hard, peaking at number one and becoming a club hit around Europe, the latter almost followed suit but peaked at number two. His debut UK album also became a hit, charting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, it is officially his second studio album following “LOL &lt;(^^,)>” which was available in most countries, charting globally. He continued to release new music including “Angel In The Night”, “Every Morning”, and “Saturday”, which all charted in the UK Top 40. Two more studio albums followed, “Bass Generation” and “Calling Time”. He was also known for his music videos as they continued a storyline starring Lucas Thorheim and Aylar Lie as well as Basshunter, himself; however, his later music videos stopped all narrative, with the exception of “Northern Line”. He also became a contestant on the seventh series of&nbsp;Celebrity Big Brother where he came fourth.</p><p>The brand new song has been written and produced by Alex Argento, Jonas Altberg, and Robert Uhlmann. “Masterpiece” draws inspiration from League Of Legends&nbsp;which is a multiplayer online battle arena video game. A lyric video for the song was dropped on the Ultra Music YouTube Channel.</p><h3>Watch Basshunter’s Lyric Video To “Masterpiece” Here:</h3><p></p><p>The lyrics of the song is taken from&nbsp;League Of Legends itself, mainly taking the characterisation of DJ Sona and using her words, “Only you can hear me summoner, what masterpiece shall we play today?” as part of the song. Other lyrics&nbsp;include the number of kills, as well as League Of Legends star, Brand, saying, “Ready to set the world on fire?” before laughing.</p><p>Rolling around the lyrics is Basshunter’s awesome beats, proving exactly why he is a top-rated DJ. They seem basic and yet it has such an addicting rhythm that works well in any party playlist. This is pure original Basshunter reinvented into 2018. His early releases were full of game samples, with “Vi sitter i Ventrilo och spelar&nbsp;DotA” – also known just as “DotA” – being inspired by the multiplayer online battle arena video game&nbsp;Defence Of The Ancients.</p><h3>Listen To Basshunter’s New Song “Masterpiece” Here:</h3><p>“Masterpiece” is available to download and stream right now, through Extensive Music under exclusive licence to Ultra Records.</p><h4>What do you make of Basshunter’s new song “Masterpiece”?
