We’re still not happy with how it ended, there were so many loose ends that just needed to be tied up; but they weren’t, leaving the fans disappointed that the show didn’t get a third season.</p><p>The Charles Pratt, Jr. developed teen drama series was loosely based off&nbsp;a series of books of the same name by Sara Shepard.</p><p></p><p>We watched events unfold between a set of twins who were separated at birth. They lived two totally different lives. Sutton decides that she wants to find her birth parents, and so asks her twin, Emma, to step into her life as she attempts to find their birth mother.</p><p>Matters become complicated as Sutton’s friends prefer Emma pretending to be Sutton. Not only that, but Sutton later returns wanting her life back, but Emma is not ready to give it up yet.</p><p>The final episode left the whole show on a complete cliff-hanger, never to be resolved; after the show got cancelled by the network. The cast, however, wanted another series, just to wrap up all the loose ends.</p><p>However, the cast has since gone on to do much greater things, although many were already established actors and actresses. We take a look at what they’ve been up to.</p><h4>Alexandra Chando (Sutton Mercer / Emma Becker)</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-lying-game-cast-where-are-they-now-02.jpg width=640 height=380 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Probably mostly known for playing Maddie Coleman in American soap opera, As The World Turns; Alexandra Chando has acted in plenty of other shows, including web series Rockville CA as Deb, Glory Daze for two episodes, and The Talent Show as Danielle.
