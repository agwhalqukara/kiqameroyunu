Did the FNB name change? It traces its origins to the Eastern <i>triocrees</i> Province Bank, which was established in Grahamstown in 1838. Due to a recession, the bank was bought out in 1874 by the Oriental Bank Corporation (OBC). The OBC faced many difficulties and decided to withdraw from South Africa, and thus the Bank of Africa was formed in 1879 to take over the OBC's <a href=#>business</a> in South Africa.</p><p class=align-left>Due to another recession, the Bank of Africa was bought out by the National Bank in 1912, becoming one of the strongest and largest banks in South Africa. However, by the 1920s, the financial institution suffered bad debts and heavy losses. That prompted them to merge with Colonial Bank and Anglo-Egyptian Bank to form Barclays.</p><p class=align-left>Following apartheid policies in South Africa, Barclays faced a disinvestment campaign forcing it to reduce its shareholding.
