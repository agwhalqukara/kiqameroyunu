This was in a stage production of A Christmas Carol. It was in 2008 where a friend suggested that he meet with Hollywood talent scout, who said he showed promise and that he was ready to head to LA. Nick then signed with The Savage Agency in LA; unfortunately, the 2007-2008 Writer’s Guild of America strike was in full swing so he and his parents returned to Washington.</p><p>In 2009, he landed the role of Ryder Scanlon on ABC Family sitcom, Melissa and Joey. He played the role until the show concluded back in 2015. In 2011, he went on a hiatus from the show where he began filming for the Disney Channel original, Frenemies. He acted alongside Disney stars, Bella Thorne and Zendaya and played the role of Jake Logan. During 2012, he also landed the lead role in the&nbsp;film The Kings Of Summer. As well as starring in an episode of Boardwalk Empire as Rowland Smith, a young thief.</p><p>In late 2013, Nick Robinson was cast in Jurassic World, the fourth instalment of the Jurassic Park franchise. He co-starred with Ty Simpkins, playing a pair of brothers who go and visit their aunt at Jurassic World. The movie then became the second highest grossing film of 2015.</p><p>He then played Ben Parish in the film adaption of The 5th Wave, which was released in January 2016. Nick Robinson’s appearances in both Jurassic World and The 5th Wave resulted in his character being written out of Melissa and Joey for multiple episodes of the final season. Although, he made a few appearances and returned for the final three episodes.</p><p>In 2016, it was announced he would star in the comedy-drama, Krystal. As well as being announced he would play Olly in the film adaptation of Everything Everything.</p><h4>Social Media Links:</h4><p><a href=#>Twitter</a> – <a href=#>Instagram</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51krqTAzqtkamhhYruqr8pmqaiamaPAsLqO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aivi-luik-partner-is-the-matildas-player-dating-anyone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aivi Luik Partner: Is The Matildas Player Dating Anyone?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-mike-lindell-s-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who are Mike Lindells children?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
