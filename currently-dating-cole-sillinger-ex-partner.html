She shared pictures of them together enjoying a vacation, revealing their relationship. Previously, she was dating her ex-boyfriend, partner, Jonny Hader.</span></strong></p><p>Canadian <a href=#><strong>singer</strong></a>, songwriter, dancer, and actor <strong>Tate Rosner McRae</strong> is better known by her stage name <strong>Tate McRae</strong>. She rose to fame at the age of thirteen after becoming the first Canadian to reach the finals of the American television competition So You Think You Can Dance. She has experience working for the RCA label and is an expert in alt-pop. Since 2011, she has been engaged in this line of employment. Additionally, she has a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers.</p><p>Tate McRae has quickly attained international notoriety in a very short period of time. Just at the age of 20, she has a huge fan following that keeps an eye on her. And recently, she has been the topic of discussion regarding her boyfriend. Is she dating anyone currently?</p><p>Previously, we discussed the <a href=#><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=#><strong>Shannon Sharpe</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ayo Edebiri</strong></a>.</p><h2>Tate McRae Is in a Relationship With Her Boyfriend, Cole Sillinger!</h2><p><strong>Tate McRae</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@tatemcrae</a>) has a boyfriend in 2023 whom she has been dating secretly since a few years ago. She has always been more interested in singing and dancing than in academics. She has always wanted to work as a singer and dancer in the entertainment sector, making herself a well-known celebrity. Despite being a well-known personality and having fans who adore and want to date her, she is quiet about her current relationship.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/09/tate-mcrae-boyfriend-2.jpg alt="Tate McRae and Cole Sillinger enjoying a vacation together. celebsindepth.com" width=720 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Tate McRae</span> and <span>Cole Sillinger enjoying a vacation together.<br></span></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Although she hasn't revealed anything publicly about her boyfriend, Tate McRae is in a relationship with <strong>Cole Sillinger </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@colesillinger</a>). The singer declared her relationship with ice hockey player Cole Sillinger on Instagram after her romance with <strong>Jonny Hader</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@johnyhader</a>) came to an end.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>On August 20, 2022, she shared pictures of them together enjoying a vacation on a boat and being cozy with one another. This post came as a revelation about their relationship. Fans were surprised and also happy regarding their relationship and soon commented on their <a href=# rel=noopener>post</a>, giving blessings and congratulating them. Other than that, there have been no posts of them together.</p><p>Rather than the post of them together without any caption, they have never acknowledged their dating life. Tate McRae is too young to commit to a lifelong relationship, so she might be avoiding the spotlight, especially her boyfriend. She might not want unnecessary attention regarding her relationship. Once celebrities get into a relationship, Paparazzi follows every step, which might be quite irritating as she cannot have privacy.</p><h2>Tate McRae and Her Boyfriend, Cole Sillinger’s Relationship Details!</h2><p>We are not sure how and when they met, but it looks like they have been a couple for a long time, and in 2022, <strong>Tate McRae</strong> made a decision to reveal it by sharing a post. But a thing that is running through every fan's head is that her current partner, <strong>Cole Sillinger</strong>, hasn't shared any of their posts together, leading fans to believe that he is not in love with her like she is.</p><p>Like his girlfriend, Cole Sillinger is a well-known figure. His father, longtime NHL player <strong>Mike Sillinger</strong>, played for 12 clubs and saw action in more than 1,000 games. Cole will likely play on the third line as he begins his third NHL season. <strong>Adam Fantilli</strong> and<strong> Boone Jenner</strong> will be in front of Sillinger, who is in the middle. With the Columbus Blue Jackets, Sillinger played in 79 games as a rookie and scored 31 points. Following that, he only managed 11 points in 64 games, failing to repeat his rookie season's performance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/09/tate-mcrae-boyfriend-1.jpg alt="Tate McRae and her boyfriend, Cole Sillinger, have been together since 2022. celebsindepth.com" width=1440 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Tate McRae</span> and her boyfriend, <span>Cole Sillinger, have been together since 2022.<br></span></strong><strong>Source: Pinterest</strong></p><p>Well, it's not necessary to post your partner to prove love. They have kept things private, but not secret. He also admitted that McRae and <strong>Charli D'Amelio</strong> were his crush during a podcast interview in 2021. The hockey player smiled and added;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>I'm shooting my shot, right?</strong></p><p>The singer later admitted that the ice hockey player got in touch with her after he confessed to having a crush on her in a video. She revealed:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Cole is best friends with the best buddy of my brother. Therefore, that was sort of the point of connection. Oh, what a coincidence that he said I was his celebrity crush, I thought.</strong></p><h2>Meet Tate McRae’s Ex-boyfriend/Partner, Jonny Hader!</h2><p>Before dating <strong>Cole Sillinger</strong>, <strong>Tate McRae</strong> dated Canadian director of photography <strong>Jonny Hader</strong>. He operated the camera in 2020 as she recorded the music video for "You Broke Me First." The duo was captured on camera having a date night at Catch LA in West Hollywood in October 2022. The musician stated that she was going through a breakup when she penned and recorded one of her top songs, "Hate Myself," in May 2022. She also talked more openly about her previous dating experiences. But they still follow each other, which means all is well between them.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGirmqyVYrqkvsCeZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-cut-people-friend-of-pastor-john-gray-threatens-local-newspaper-for-airing-embattled-pastor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Cut People: Friend of Pastor John Gray Threatens Local Newspaper for Airing Embattled Pastor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./roman-reigns-explains-part-time-contract-wwe-rumors-on-solo-sikoa-and-bronson-reed-news-scores.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Roman Reigns Explains Part-Time Contract; WWE Rumors on Solo Sikoa and Bronson Reed | News, Scores,</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
