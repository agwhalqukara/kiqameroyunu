The celebrity father smiled while holding his youngest son, Agyemang, in his arms. The youngster, who has grown by leaps and bounds these past four years, was joined by his older brother, Uriah, who sat beside his father for the perfect candid.</p><p>“My handsome boys,” Lilit said of her husband and sons. “What a gorgeous shot,” one social media follower shared. “They look like twins,” another exclaimed in reference to Uriah and Agyemang’s physical appeal. “Adorable,” the Instagram fan concluded.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bush4.jpg decoding=async alt width=640 height=480 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a href=#>Reggie Bush</a> is taking more time to spend with his family following his retirement from the NFL. The star athlete recently told <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE</a> exclusively about his life after playing professional sports.</p><p>“I’ve been able to enjoy more time with our family and just being able to do things that I normally wouldn’t be able to be here for,” Reggie shared with the press. “For 20-plus years, most of my time was devoted to a single sport. Now I get an opportunity to be home, and to find a new passion and keep my focus on top of my family,” the celebrity father added.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bush5.jpg decoding=async alt width=640 height=640 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“We’ve been really focusing on this time with our family and trying to better ourselves,” Reggie said of the vibe in his household post-lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s definitely been a challenge for us to homeschool but together we feel like we’ve been learning in this process a lot about ourselves, and we’re making it work,” <a href=#>Bush</a> shared.</p><p>“Our patience had to develop a lot more than it was,” Lilit said when speaking of the lessons she and her husband learned while on lockdown with their children. “We have to learn how to be a lot more patient with each other and with the kids, because being with them all day long can push you to another level, stress wise,” Mrs. Bush admitted. “We just simply cannot allow that to translate to the kids.”</p><p>Lilit and Reggie Bush have three kids – Uriah, Agyemang, and Briseis – in all.</p><p>Photo: Lilit Bush/Instagram</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>280</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOq5ygn5maeqPB0qGqZq%2BZm7JuuMiloK1lo52us7HSZqehp6SkwG67xWafnqpdna6vsNKopJ5lkqTGtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./squeezy-snake.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Squeezy snake</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-s-body-evolution-through-the-years.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian's Body Evolution Through the Years</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
