The performer continues to be well-liked and is well-known for playing Buzz Lightyear in the “Toy Story” film series. He has also won recognition for his work as a voice actor. Aside from his work in “More Power” and “Assembly Required,” his current appearance as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus in “The Santa Clauses” has also contributed to his increased fame.

She has remained a vital component of the entertainment business over the years as an actor and was most recently seen in “Grey’s Anatomy” as Tessa Hobbes. She plays Maddie in the movie “Country Line: No Fear.” As of the time of writing, Patricia is the mother of Ray Baker’s three children from her previous marriage: Henry, Roxanne, and Joseph Baker.

Wilson Jr. on the ABC sitcom. He continued to work in the entertainment sector and participated in a number of television shows before passing away. But the actor died of lung cancer on December 29, 2003, in Stamford, Connecticut.
