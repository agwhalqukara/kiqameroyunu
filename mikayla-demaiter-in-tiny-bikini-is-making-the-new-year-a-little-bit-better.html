On January 9, she finally decided to post a few photos that featured her posing in a black bikini that was tied in front of her chest.

Not even the smallest one that you are one of the most beautiful women on earth! For sure top level,” another follower wrote. “I’m at a loss for words. So grateful to be blessed with your beauty!!” a third fan exclaimed.</p><p>“How I wish that a star as beautiful as you would illuminate my sky on my lonely nights. I may not know you in person but that doesn’t stop me from sighing with all my strength for you. Smile!!! May it be a blessed and extraordinary day for you,” another follower commented, leaving Mikayla to respond, “Thank you for the heartfelt message as always. I hope you have a great day!”</p><h2>Mikayla Reveals What Heaven’s Dress Code Looks Like</h2><p>Fans often joke that the popular model looks like an angel, but in one Instagram post, she actually gave fans a glimpse of what the dress code in heaven looked like while standing in the pool in a two-piece bathing suit. Her long blonde hair fell around her face as she smoldered for the shot, accessorizing her look with dangling gold hoop earrings and a hoop necklace.</p><p>“No one follows the dress code for heaven better than me,” she wrote in the caption.

If so, he is the luckiest man in the world.”</p><h2>Mikayla Is The ‘Lady In Red’</h2><p>In another post, the social media sensation traveled all the way to Palm Springs, California, to show off her fit figure in a red top that perfectly complimented her large chest. The lacy red bodice was tucked into a pair of daisy dukes that hugged her slim thighs. Her long blonde hair fell in loose waves around her face as she posed for a trio of photos, giving fans a rear view of her fit figure in the last shot.</p><p>“Wearing a bright color to continue my ongoing pursuit of brightening up your life,” she wrote in the caption. “If you’re trying to do something other than what you’re showing me, it isn’t working so don’t change your ways, sweetheart,” one follower commented. “Lady in red, I love you with all of my heart,” another fan gushed. “Wow, what a gorgeous woman!” another follower agreed while another fan called her “super beautiful and stunning as usual”</p><p>Interested in more Mikayla Demaiter content?
