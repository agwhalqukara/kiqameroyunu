But still, limited details were shared with the public, and rumors have since circulated about the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Oscar winner's condition</a>. Now, former boxer <strong>Mike Tyson</strong> seems to have answers, claiming that he heard why Jamie was really hospitalized.

"I don't know what's going to happen now, but you know, it's a strong possibility."</p><p><strong>Michael Franzese</strong>, who also appeared on the podcast episode, then asked again about whether there's been any news or updates on Foxx's current condition, calling the actor a "young, vibrant, healthy guy." Tyson responded saying the public might not get the answers they're looking for.</p><p>"If we don't know by now, they don't want us to know," he said.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel=noopener>For more up-to-date information, sign up for ourdaily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/shutterstock_2189679051.jpg><p>Foxx has reportedly been at a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>rehabilitation center</a> in Chicago since April, TMZ first reported, so Tyson's statements might actually have some weight.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>According to&nbsp;Page Six, the center <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>specializes in stroke recovery</a>, traumatic brain injury rehabilitation, spinal cord injury rehabilitation, and cancer rehabilitation.
