Television, which means that it can license the show to different broadcasters and platforms around the world.</p><p>In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Manifest is exclusive to Sky and its streaming service NowTV, which has the rights to the show until at least March 31st, 20251.</p><p>In other countries, such as Canada, Manifest is available on Global TV and its streaming service StackTV2.</p><p>Netflix only has the rights to stream Manifest in certain regions, such as the United States, Australia, India, and most of Europe.</p><h2><span id=Netflix_Has_to_Wait_for_Previous_Deals_to_Expire_or_Buy_Them_Out>Netflix Has to Wait for Previous Deals to Expire or Buy Them Out</span></h2><p>Another reason why Netflix doesn’t have seasons 2 and 3 of Manifest in some regions is because it has to wait for previous deals to expire or buy them out.</p><p>For example, in the Netherlands, Netflix only had season 1 of Manifest until January 1st, 2022, when it added season 2 as well.</p><p>However, season 3 is still not available on Netflix in the Netherlands, because it is still airing on RTL4, a local broadcaster.</p><p>Netflix may have to wait until RTL4 finishes airing season 3 or negotiate with them to acquire the rights sooner.</p><p>Similarly, in France, season 3 of Manifest is still airing on TF1, another local broadcaster.</p><p>Netflix may face the same challenges in other countries where local broadcasters still have the rights to season 3.</p><h2><span id=Netflix_May_Not_Want_to_Confuse_or_Spoil_Viewers>Netflix May Not Want to Confuse or Spoil Viewers</span></h2><p>A third reason why Netflix doesn’t have seasons 2 and 3 of Manifest in some regions is because it may not want to confuse or spoil viewers.</p><p>For instance, some viewers in the United Kingdom reported that after finishing season 1 of Manifest on Netflix, the autoplay feature automatically started playing season 4 instead of season 2.</p><p>This resulted in a huge spoiler and a lot of confusion for those who were not aware that seasons 2 and 3 were missing from Netflix UK.</p><p>Netflix may have decided to avoid this problem by not adding seasons 2 and 3 until they can add all four seasons at once.</p><p>This way, viewers can watch the entire series without any gaps or interruptions.</p><h2><span id=When_Will_Seasons_2_and_3_of_Manifest_Be_on_Netflix>When Will Seasons 2 and 3 of Manifest Be on Netflix?</span></h2><p>The good news is that Netflix has renewed Manifest for a fourth and final season, which will consist of 20 episodes and will be released in two parts.</p><p>The first part of season 4 will premiere on November 4th, 2022 on Netflix worldwide.</p><p>This means that even if you can’t watch seasons 2 and 3 on Netflix right now, you will be able to watch season 4 along with everyone else.</p><p>However, if you want to catch up on seasons 2 and 3 before watching season 4, you may have to use other options, such as buying or renting them on digital platforms like Amazon Prime Video or iTunes.</p><p>Alternatively, you can hope that Netflix will add seasons 2 and 3 soon in your region or that your local broadcaster will air them before season 4 arrives.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>Manifest is a captivating show that has captivated millions of viewers around the world.</p><p>However, not everyone can watch seasons 2 and 3 on Netflix due to various reasons related to licensing and distribution.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you understand why this is the case and what you can do about it.</p><p>If you are a fan of Manifest, don’t give up hope, and keep checking Netflix for updates.</p><p>You never know when seasons 2 and 3 may appear on your screen.</p><p>1: Why Aren’t Seasons 1-3 of ‘Manifest’ on Netflix UK?</p><p>2: Will ‘Manifest’ Season 3 Be on Netflix?
