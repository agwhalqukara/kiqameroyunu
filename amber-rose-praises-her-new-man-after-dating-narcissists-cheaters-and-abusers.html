More than once, she said on social media that she’d been hurt a lot of narcissistic, abusive people.</p><p>Now, thankfully things are quite different&nbsp;with her new boyfriend, and she proclaims&nbsp;her love for him in public.</p><p>‘He thinks he soooo cute! 🙄😒 He really is tho 😩🤗😍 and sweet, smart, talented, charismatic and overall just an amazing man. In the past I’ve used the words “best friend” very loosely while speaking of my ex’s but I can honestly say I feel like this man really is my BEST FRIEND! We talk for hours, he makes me a better person, he listens to me and understands me. He also came into my life at a time where I’ve had enough of the narcissistic, cheating and abuse I’ve endured over the years from my previous relationships…..’ Amber wrote.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BtKpzSigkeP/</p><p>She continued and explained: ‘Me always apologizing for things I had no business apologizing for, being gaslighted, manipulated and mentally abused 😔 I felt so damaged when I met him and pushed him away in the beginning, he has talked me through everything while simultaneously loving me and working with me so I could overcome my fear of loving someone in the healthiest way again. So @ae4president Thank you for all of ur love and support baby. I love you so much. 😘🤗🥰😇’</p><p>Her followers appreciated what she has at the moment, but some people also slammed her for changing men to quickly.</p><p>Someone said ‘He’s your man until you find another one, you don’t even know the definition of a good man because you ain’t had no man besides dating KIDS.. I don’t see any change you’re still the same 🤷🏿‍♀️💯’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsWlv9wAaK9/</p><p>One fan defended Amber and gushed over her happiness: ‘That’s because he’s a REAL man @amberrose . My man is my best friend too because he does everything your man does for you. You deserve to be with someone who brightens your day just by a one word text. Who will make you WANT to be a better person. Who will support you no matter what. I have been following you for years, & I am so happy that you’re happy. God bless 🙏🏻😘😍♥️’</p><p>Amber was in the spotlight recently again after she revealed <a href=#>she used to be a drug dealer</a>.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She revealed recently that she tried her hand at drug dealing in the streets of Philly.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoq%2BmvoyrpqydXaW%2ForXSnqpmoJWneq%2Bx1makmqZdlrO1sdFmm5qsmaO0brrAq5qiq6OewLW%2FjJyfnpmkmr%2B0ecCnm2aZkqrApr7SZmlscWdlhHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-stamos-gives-josh-peck-bunny-ears-at-turner-hooch-premiere.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Stamos Gives Josh Peck Bunny Ears at 'Turner &amp;amp; Hooch' Premiere</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yoo-se-yoon-comedian-age-birthday-bio-facts-family-net-worth-height-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yoo Se-yoon (Comedian) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
