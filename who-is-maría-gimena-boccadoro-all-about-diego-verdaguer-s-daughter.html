Albeit, the only information available about her is that she was a law student back then in Argentina at the time they met with Gimena’s father.</p><p>Gimena’s parents are Latin Americans from Argentina, however, most of their lives were spent working and living in Mexico. Gimena’s father, Diego had to separate from her biological mother due to very rough living conditions and went in search of a better life which brought him to Mexico.</p><p>After her father’s separation from her biological mother, Gimena lived with her mother at the early stage of her childhood. While in Mexico, her father started pursuing and developing his musical career. Eventually, the marriage between her parents ended and her mother remarried, however, there is still no information regarding her marriage as well.</p><p>Diego Verdaguer’s foray into music in Mexico led him to the path of Amanda Miguel, Maria’s stepmother.

Amanda Miguel became popular after the release of her music albums from 1981 to 1989, and between that being a wife and a dedicated mother.</p><h2><strong>Maria Gimena Has Two Younger Sisters</strong></h2><p>Gimena may be the only child from the short relationship her biological parents had but she is not the only child they have from their subsequent relationships.
