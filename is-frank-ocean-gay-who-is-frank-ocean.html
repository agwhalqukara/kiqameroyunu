known by his stage name <a href=#><strong>Frank Ocean</strong></a>, is a notable American vocalist, lyricist, and rapper acknowledged for his distinctive musical flair, reflective verses, and inventive approach to the art of sound.</p><p>His birthdate is October 28, 1987.</p><p>Ocean emerged prominently in the realm of music by fusing R&B, soul, and hip-hop elements in an original manner.</p><p>He initiated his journey as a behind-the-scenes songwriter for fellow musicians before ascending to his own prominent position.</p><p>Ocean’s trajectory witnessed a pivotal moment with his inclusion in the <a href=#><strong>hip-hop</strong></a> collective Odd Future in the year 2010.</p><p>In 2011, he unveiled his inaugural mixtape titled “Nostalgia, Ultra,” which garnered

known as Frank Ocean, was born on October 28, 1987, in Long Beach, <a href=#><strong>California</strong></a>.</p><p>His formative years were characterized by a blend of experiences that would profoundly influence his artistic path.</p><p>His father, Calvin Edward Cooksey, had a background as a singer and keyboardist, while his mother, Katonya Breaux Riley, eventually pursued a career as a residential contractor.</p><p>Following his parents’ separation when he was just six years old, Ocean’s upbringing was primarily overseen by his mother.</p><p>Tragically, he also endured the heart-wrenching loss of his younger sibling, Ryan Breaux, who passed away in a car accident in 2020.</p><p>The family relocated to the New Orleans vicinity when Ocean was five, where he was raised within a Christian household that briefly practiced Catholicism.</p><p>Ocean’s maternal grandfather, Lionel McGruder Jr., emerged as a prominent fatherly figure in his life subsequent to his father’s departure.</p><p>McGruder, a recovering drug addict who guided others in AA and NA meetings, significantly impacted Ocean’s outlook and artistic expression.</p><p>He affectionately bestowed the moniker “Lonny” upon Ocean, a name that endures in the artist’s identity.</p><p>McGruder’s passing in 2010 served as inspiration for Ocean’s track “There Will Be Tears” on his mixtape titled “Nostalgia, Ultra.”</p><p>Additionally, he was referenced in Ocean’s 2017 single “Lens.”</p><p>Following his completion of studies at John Ehret High School in Marrero, Louisiana, in 2005, Ocean embarked on his academic pursuit by enrolling at the University of New Orleans to study English.</p><p>Nonetheless, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 resulted in the destruction of Ocean’s home and personal recording space.</p><p>Consequently, he had to transfer to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.</p><p>Despite a brief period of attendance, Ocean ultimately made the choice to depart from his academic endeavors, redirecting his focus towards his burgeoning music career.</p><h2><span id=Frank_Ocean_Age>Frank Ocean Age</span></h2><p>Frank Ocean, born on October 28,
