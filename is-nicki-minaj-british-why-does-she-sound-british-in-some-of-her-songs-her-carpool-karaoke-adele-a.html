Minaj gave a fantastic Adele impression while in the notorious automobile, leaving many baffled as to how she picked up the accent.</p><h2 id=h-carpool-karaoke-is-back-in-style>Carpool Karaoke is back in style</h2><p>Due to restrictions in the pandemic, the Late Late Show had to remove the popular segment from the show to keep everyone safe. But itâ€™s finally back to the excitement of viewers, and fans of the celebrity guests.</p><p>In a previous episode, Adele did a rendition of Minajâ€™s verse from the Kanye West song â€˜Monsterâ€™, which Nicki also performed in the segment, creating one of the best mashups in recent history.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>THE <a href=#>@NICKIMINAJ</a> X <a href=#>@ADELE</a> MONSTER DUET THE WORLD DESERVES <a href=#>#NICKICARPOOL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r2aek32nH4</a></p><p>â€” The Late Late Show with James Corden (@latelateshow) <a href=#>April 7, 2022</a></p><p>This instalment of Carpool Karaoke shows Nicki as the queen of rap, but also a more vulnerable side to her as she talks about anxiety and the pressure as a public figure.</p><p>Between cackles and iconic verses, she shared that as a woman in the public eye youâ€™re constantly scrutinised for your choices and actions, and that it does impact your mental health.</p><p>She explained how she now no longer has the sense of freedom that she did when she first started her career in rap.</p><p>Despite the sincere and charming moments from Minaj, she still kept the energy up during the drive, including playing the clarinet and cracking jokes alongside Corden.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@nickiminaj</a> teaching James about "ops" is one of the most important things ever captured on film <a href=#>#NICKICARPOOL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VwZcj4vjHX</a></p><p>â€” The Late Late Show with James Corden (@latelateshow) <a href=#>April 7, 2022</a></p><p>The full segment is available on YouTube,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch here.</a></p><h2 id=h-is-nicki-minaj-british>Is Nicki Minaj British?</h2><p>After watching Carpool Karaoke, a lot of people picked up on Nickiâ€™s Adele impersonation.

In fact, she was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">born in the Caribbean</a>, before moving to Queens, New York at the age of 5.</p><p>Throughout her career, sheâ€™s kept a strong connection to her Trinidadian roots, with her style and aspects of her music videos, for example dressing in festival attire in Pound The Alarm.</p><p>Before her music career took off, she worked a number of waitressing jobs. One of these included a Red Lobster in the Bronx, which she was fired from for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">discourtesy to customers</a>. Minaj also revealed this was an issue that lost her a few jobs in her late teens and early adult life.</p><p>However, she spoke about her jobs on a podcast with RuPaul Charles and Michelle Visage, saying that the money she earned from waitressing&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">helped her to buy a BMW</a>.</p><h2 id=h-this-isn-t-the-first-time-nicki-minaj-does-a-british-accent>This isnâ€™t the first time Nicki Minaj does a British accent</h2><p>For long time fans of Minaj, youâ€™d know this isnâ€™t the first time sheâ€™s done a British accent.</p><p>Nicki has a whole roster of alter egos within her music, including an â€˜inner demonâ€™ named Roman Zolanski.</p><p>Another ego that she has is the mother of Roman, Martha. Martha speaks with a British accent, which can be heard in several songs, especially in the opening to â€˜Roman Holidayâ€™, the opening track from her 2012 album Pink Fridayâ€¦ Roman Reloaded.</p><p>However, she has pulled out the accent in different situations too. In one instance, Minaj sends a message to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, joking that she was in fact born in the UK, and even went to university with former PM Margaret Thatcher.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ send this to the prime minister & let him know they lied on me.
