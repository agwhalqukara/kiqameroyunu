This indicates that your caloric intake is less than your burning rate. You may lose weight as a result of your body using fat, which is stored energy, as fuel when you do this. Khara Lewis may have begun eating fewer calories by selecting items with fewer calories and limiting portion sizes.</p><p>The reality star could have also shunned sugary drinks and processed foods. Perhaps she consumes more protein: After eating, protein makes you feel full and happy, which may encourage you to eat less in general. She could be consuming more fiber because it can help control blood sugar levels and make you feel full after eating. She possibly avoids processed meals and sugar-filled beverages.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/11/khara-lewis-weight-loss-1.jpg alt="Khara Lewis before the weight loss. celebsindepth.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Khara Lewis before the weight loss.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Processed meals and sugary drinks are frequently poor in nutrients and heavy in calories. You may eat better and lose pounds by limiting certain meals and beverages. Khara Lewis could have started working out frequently and adding cardio to her workout routine. Running, swimming, and biking are examples of cardio exercises that assist in increasing cardiovascular health and burn calories.</p><p>According to her most <a href=# rel=noopener>recent Instagram post</a>, she competed in a race. On the other hand, it is also possible that she may have lost weight due to aging. As people become older, their metabolisms slow down, which makes it harder to keep a healthy weight. It is important to note that the above information is speculative. In the end, only Khara Lewis is certain of her weight loss reasons. We will get back to you soon after she decides to discuss it in public.</p><h2>Know More About Khara Lewis!</h2><p><strong>Khara Lewis&nbsp;</strong>(b.
