It profoundly altered the balance of power in Europe and resulted in more than eight million casualties across the continent.</p><h2>1861: The First Transcontinental Telegraph Line Is Completed</h2><p>The Western Union Telegraph Company links the eastern and western telegraph networks at Salt Lake City, Utah. As the nation’s first transcontinental telegraph line — finished eight years before the transcontinental railroad — it connected the nation like never before.</p><p>The line heralded a new age of communications and marked the end of previous methods of sharing information and news like the Pony Express. Before the transcontinental telegraph allowed messages to be sent almost instantaneously, it routinely took nearly four months for communications to travel from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific.</p><h2>1901: Annie Edson Taylor Goes Down Niagara Falls In A Barrel</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-388570 alt="Annie Edson Taylor" width=600 height=803 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/annie-edson-taylor.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-388570 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><span class=caption-body>Annie Edson Taylor poses next to her barrel in 1902.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Annie Edson Taylor</a>, a 63-year-old Civil War widow, climbs herself into a barrel lined with cushions and goes over Niagara Falls.

But the stunt didn’t result in a windfall as Taylor had hoped. It did inspire several copycats, however, some of whom died in their attempt.</p><h2>1982: Rose Bundy Is Born</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Rose Bundy</a> is born. The daughter of serial killer Ted Bundy and his wife Carole Ann Boone, Rose was born while her father was on death row awaiting execution for the murders he’d committed across seven states.</p><p>Boone and Bundy had known each other for years before he was arrested, but he only proposed to her after she testified in his defense at his murder trial in 1980. Afterward, she managed several conjugal visits with him in prison.
