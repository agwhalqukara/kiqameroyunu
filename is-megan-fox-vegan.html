However, she supports those who follow a vegan lifestyle through a variety of ways, including her own past dietary habits and by sending her children to a “vegan school.”</strong></p><p>With Megan Fox, there is more to her than what meets the eye. While many believe that she is stunningly beautiful, she also supports various campaigns to promote the wellbeing of the world–particularly in nature, plant-based organizations.<br></p><p>You can see Fox, as she co-hosted the #Fight4TheAmazon campaign, a campaign that supports the preservation of the Amazon RainForest, using the Instagram link below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Plant-Based Living</h2><p>Megan Fox is often known for her model good looks and her fit physique. Therefore, it makes sense that people are curious about her daily lifestyle, including her diet.&nbsp;</p><p>While she does not follow a vegan diet, that does not mean that she has not in the past. Fox followed a very strict diet in <a href=# rel=noopener>2011</a>, but she has since changed her diet back to one that includes meat, dairy, and other animal-based products.&nbsp;</p><p>During that time in 2011, for about a year and a half total, Megan Fox followed a <a href=# rel=noopener>strict vegan</a> diet that included raw fruits and vegetables, but prohibited bread, sugar, and coffee. However, Fox claims that she had lost too much weight following her strict vegan diet, so now she eats “a bit of <a href=# rel=noopener>everything</a>.”</p><p>To help gain back the curves she desired and weight that she had lost, Megan Fox follows a fitness plan of doing high intensity circuit training with her trainer, <a href=# rel=noopener>Harley Pasternak</a>, three times a week. She occasionally lifts <a href=# rel=noopener>heavy weights </a>as well.</p><p>Her trainer, Pasternak, also introduced Fox to her new diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Megan Fox now follows a <a href=# rel=noopener>5 Factor diet</a>, which means that she eats five small meals a day, making sure they include the dietary factors of healthy fats, lean protein, fiber, and an unsweetened drink.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the foods she <a href=# rel=noopener>eats</a> the most include Japanese food, egg whites, almonds, salmon, and smoothies.</p><p>So, while Megan Fox might not be vegan, she still follows a healthy lifestyle–and supports her affinity for Mother Earth in other ways.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sending Her Children to “Vegan School”</h2><p>While Megan Fox does not follow a vegan dietary plan, she still follows some of the similar vegan principles of being one with the world we inhabit.&nbsp;</p><p>Megan Fox sends her children to a <a href=# rel=noopener>vegan school</a>, with the hopes that they will learn that plants are “sentiment beings with feelings, thoughts, and emotions.” Fox hopes that these teachings will lead her children to grow up to become more compassionate human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Megan Fox and her now ex-husband, Brian Austin Green, have decided that they will take on a unique parenting style. Instead of shaping their children to align with their beliefs, the duo has <a href=# rel=noopener>decided</a> to “support the process, not to get involved and micromanage and mold them into what [they] think they should be.”</p><p>It is a liberal parenting style, but it works for this family. At their vegan school, Megan Fox <a href=# rel=noopener>shared</a> that the kids have seed-to-table food, plant, grow, and harvest their own food to take to local restaurants and sell it so they understand how this process works.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Fox adds</a> that she is very strict about not harming animals, such as stepping on ants, or ripping flowers out of the ground because they look beautiful.</p><p>Fox continues to use her platform to advocate for <a href=# rel=noopener>environmental issues</a>, and, you never know, this might just be the beginning of a surge for vegan schools.&nbsp;</p><p>You can hear more about Megan Fox’s opinions and reasoning behind sending her children to a vegan school in this interview with David Spade, using the YouTube link below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqKqZqWVnK6vecWor2aulZyur3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./memorable-battleground-in-texas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Memorable battleground in Texas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./doesn-t-sit-idly-by.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Doesn't sit idly by</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./8-2002-eminem-film.html>8 ___ (2002 Eminem film)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./b-simone-bio-age-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height.html>B.
